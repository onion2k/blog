A fundamental part of any React application is the way the page is orchestrated using a collection of components. Getting components right is a vital part of any successful React project.

The first thing to understand about a React component is that it is not the same as an HTML element despite the syntax looking incredibly similar in some instances. A `<div>` in JSX is not the same thing as a `<div>` in HTML.

Components in JSX are functionally Javascript clojures under the surface. This means that Javascript needs to count references to each of them, and to keep an area of memory allocated to it, and consequently garbage to be collected if they're ever unallocated and removed from the page. React needs to keep a unique reference to each one. Where an application in Vue appears to be HTML with Javascript decoration, and in Angular things are HTML templates populated by Javascript, in React there *effectively* is no user-creaetd HTML. There is only JSX and Javascript. What gets displayed on the page is abstract code generated by the React app. **You are not writing HTML.**

What this means in practise is really that you should think of React component as mini applications that output code rather than elements on the page.

There are two main ways to create a React component. They're effectively interchangable, but it's quite useful to think of them as separate as it makes it more obvious what each component is for.

The first method is an anonymous function. It looks like this;

```javascript
import React from react;

export default function(){
	return (<h1 className='MyComponent'>My title, in JSX</h1>);
}
```

The alternative is to extend the React component class;

```javascript
import React from react;

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
	render(){
		return (<h1 className='MyComponent'>My title, in JSX</h1>);
	}
}
```

In both cases the React library needs to be imported in to the current scope in order for JSX to work. In the first example however that's literally all that's necessary.

To display either of the components we can simply import them in to a React app.

```javascript{2,8}
import React from 'react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.js';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <Test />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

There isn't much more to say about the anonymous component function. If all you need is to render some JSX to HTML then this option is ideal. It keeps the code simple, and consequently fast, but not appreciably faster than a component extension class. It's main advantage is its simplicity.

The second way relies on extending the React component base class, which is a little more complicated, but affords the component a wealth of additional features such as lifetime callbacks, an optional constructor method, a way of managing the component's state, and more.
